Libft has been created for the Core curses at 42 Wolfsburg.

The intention is to create a library of functions.

## Status:
- Actual status:  Submitted.

## Technical considerations:
• Declaring global variables is forbidden.
• To split a more complex function, define them as static functions. 
This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file.
• Place all your files at the root of your repository.
• Turning in unused files is forbidden.
• Every .c files must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
• You must use the command ar to create your library. Using the libtool command is forbidden.
• Your libft.a has to be created at the root of your repository.
