This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file.
• Place all your files at the root of your repository.
• Turning in unused files is forbidden.
• Every .c files must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
• You must use the command ar to create your library. Using the libtool command is forbidden.
